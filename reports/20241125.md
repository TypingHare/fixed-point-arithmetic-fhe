## Fixed-Point Reciprocal Implementation with Power-of-Two Approximation

### Finding Initial Guess for Division in Fixed-Point Arithmetic

Finding an appropriate initial guess for division in fixed-point arithmetic is
critical. There are four common approaches for finding an initial guess:

- **Power-of-Two Approximation**: If $D$ is a positive number in a known range,
  find the largest power of $2$, $2^k$, such that $2^k < D$. The
  reciprocal $2^{-k}$ would be a good initial guess.
- **Linear Approximation**: If the range of $D$ is limited, say $(0.5, 2)$, then
  we can approximate the reciprocal by $R_0 = 2.0 - D$.
- **Table Lookup**: Divide $D$ into segments and store precomputed values
  of $1/D$ in a lookup table.

Among the three approaches, the Power-of-Two Approximation stands out as the
most practical and shows significant promise for implementation with TFHE.

### Power-of-Two Approximation Examples

Suppose we use a 32-bit integer $v$ and an exponent $e$ to represent a
fractional number $f$, it would be

$$
f = v \cdot 2^{-e}
$$

If we want to find the initial guess of $f^{-1}$, we start by finding **the
largest power of 2 that is less than $f$**. We can achieve this by finding the
position of the leading $1$ in the integer $v$

```rust
fn get_leading_one_index(value: i32) -> i32 {
    // Find the leading 1 in the name value using bitwise operations
    let mut i = 31;
    while i > 0 {
        if (1 << i) & value > 0 {
            return i;
        }
        i -= 1;
    }

    0
}
```

Denote the index of the leading $1$ as $i$. The initial guess can be represented
as:

$$
R_0 = 2^{2e - i}
$$

Then, we can apply the Newton-Raphson method to find a more accurate approximation.

### Difficulty in Implementing using TFHE

TFHE provides bitwise operations on integers. However, we cannot tell when `(1 << i) & value` would be greater than $0$. Thus, we cannot determine the position of the leading $1$.

### Taylor Series

Ram sent this approximation approach to me the other day. However, the convergence radius is too small. I don't know under what situations could this approach come in handy. 

$$
\frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{1-(1-x)}
$$

Converges only if $|1-x|<1$, namely , $0 < x < 2$.

$$
\frac{1}{1-(1-x)} = 1 + (1-x) + (1-x)^2+(1-x)^3 + \cdots
$$
